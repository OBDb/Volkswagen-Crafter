    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Crafter was developed as a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz, essentially a rebadged version of the Mercedes Sprinter with Volkswagen-specific front-end styling, interior elements, and engine options. Available in multiple body configurations including panel van, minibus, single and double cab chassis variants, the Crafter served as Volkswagen's largest commercial vehicle offering, replacing the LT series. Engine options centered around a range of 2.5-liter five-cylinder TDI diesel units initially, later replaced by more efficient 2.0-liter four-cylinder TDI engines following a facelift in 2011, with power outputs ranging from approximately 88 to 163 horsepower. Transmission choices included six-speed manual and optional automated manual transmissions, driving either the rear wheels or all four wheels in 4MOTION variants. The interior prioritized functionality over luxury, though with a more car-like dashboard design than many competitors, higher-quality materials in passenger-focused variants, and available features including navigation and enhanced comfort options not commonly found in commercial vehicles of the era. Available in three wheelbase lengths, three roof heights, and with gross vehicle weights ranging from 3.0 to 5.0 tonnes, the Crafter offered exceptional versatility for various commercial applications. While the Mercedes-Benz collaboration provided Volkswagen with a cost-effective entry into the large van segment, the sharing of so many components with a direct competitor created challenges in establishing a distinct identity for the Crafter, leading Volkswagen to develop its successor independently rather than continuing the joint venture arrangement."

    description: "The second-generation Volkswagen Crafter marks the model's first independent development, designed and manufactured entirely by Volkswagen rather than through a joint venture with Mercedes-Benz. Built at a dedicated new factory in Poland, the Crafter features distinctive styling aligned with Volkswagen's contemporary design language, with a prominent grille, angular headlights, and a more modern overall appearance than its predecessor. Available in an extensive range of configurations including panel van, single and double cab chassis, minibus, and numerous specialized conversions, with three length options, three roof heights, and multiple weight ratings up to 5.5 tonnes, the Crafter offers exceptional versatility for commercial users. Engine options center around a 2.0-liter four-cylinder TDI diesel in various states of tune, with power outputs ranging from approximately 102 to 177 horsepower, paired with six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic transmissions. Notably, the Crafter offers three drive configurations: front-wheel drive (new to this generation), rear-wheel drive, or 4MOTION all-wheel drive, allowing buyers to select the option best suited to their specific requirements—an unusual level of choice in the segment. The interior represents a significant advancement with a more car-like dashboard design featuring higher quality materials, improved ergonomics, and available technology including a touchscreen infotainment system, adaptive cruise control, and comprehensive driver assistance systems such as side protection, park assist, and crosswind assist—features rarely found in commercial vehicles. An all-electric e-Crafter variant was introduced in select markets from 2018, featuring a 100 kW electric motor and 35.8 kWh battery providing approximately 115 miles of range, primarily aimed at urban delivery applications. The second-generation Crafter has achieved critical acclaim for its blend of practicality, technology, and driving refinement, winning multiple commercial vehicle awards and helping Volkswagen strengthen its position in the competitive large van segment across global markets."
